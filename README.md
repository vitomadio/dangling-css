## Dangling CSS
Is a CLI utility made in Node.js that checks for selectors from a Scss or Css file that are not been used in the Html file next to it. 

This utility is better used for very defined components that are isolated and grouped inside folders where only have one style type of file and one html.  

**NOTE:** This is a work in progress project and might have bugs.

### Installation
```$ npm i -g dangling-css```

### How it works
Dangling-css is very easy to run, just go to the directory where the files are and type: 

```$ check-css```
